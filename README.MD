🤖 RANA: Real-time Adaptive Neural Agent
RANA (Real-time Adaptive Neural Agent) is an intelligent multimodal AI system designed to classify and interpret human facial emotions in real time. RANA fuses powerful deep learning architectures with advanced adaptive techniques for robust, resource-efficient emotion recognition.

🚀 Overview
RANA combines:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like ResNeXt-50 and MiniXception

A facial emotion dataset (FER-2013)

Real-time webcam integration

YOLOv5 for efficient face detection

Custom adaptive learning logic, including dynamic computation

This allows RANA to perform:

🎯 Emotion classification with 7 key emotions

🖼️ Face detection and cropping

🔁 Self-improvement via adaptive learning loops

📦 Future scalability to multimodal contexts (e.g., text + vision)

🔍 Emotion Classes
Angry 😠

Disgust 🤢

Fear 😨

Happy 😄

Neutral 😐

Sad 😢

Surprise 😲

🛠️ Core Components
📦 CNN Backbone
Initially trained using ResNeXt-50

Deployed in real-time with MiniXception for speed and efficiency

🎯 Training
Dataset: FER-2013 (grayscale, 48x48 images)

Data Augmentation: Horizontal flips, normalization

Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss

Optimizer: Adam

🧠 Adaptive Computation
Adaptive Forward: The core logic is being enhanced to allow the model to use only the necessary number of computational layers, reducing latency for simpler emotion predictions.

Triton Acceleration: We are exploring NVIDIA's Triton to develop and deploy custom, high-performance GPU kernels for the adaptive forward pass, significantly boosting efficiency.
